howdy howdy Quark and WunWae!

so the main thing to keep in mind with this is modularity and user repair or modification. I would love to use either a 16-pin ribbon or JST connector between the two "hands", and it should be easily removable by an end user. I also would like scalability in mind, so I would like to be able to have a PCB Assembly Fab solder in the ribbon/JST connectors for the PCB rather than have to solder them manually.

Finally, I would like to have a replacable USB-C connector for the main connector. This should have PC and Nintendo Console functionality, and should be mounted to the small block inside the "front" plate using two small screws.

I will be updating the STEP model for the frame once I have a better idea of how to mount the plates to the bottom and sides of the frame without screws. This is both a cost saving measure (these screws are like $0.40/pc) and an aesthetic consideration (they look better without screws).

I may use traditional MBK keycaps for color variety and ease of availability, this will be decided later.

Godspeed, let's make this shit.
